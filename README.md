# Predictive Analytics Research Project — Customer Behaviour & Transactional Insights
This project forms part of my postgraduate work in Predictive Analytics and focuses on the application of statistical learning methods and data-driven modelling techniques to a complex e-commerce customer dataset.

The dataset contains a diverse range of behavioural and operational attributes, including subscription status, payment preferences, shipping type, discount and promotional usage, purchase frequency, temporal purchase patterns, and regional segments. The primary research objective was to investigate how these factors influence customer purchasing behaviour and to develop predictive models that support evidence-based decision-making.

🧠 Research Focus & Objectives

Conduct a rigorous end-to-end analytical workflow aligned with industry and academic data science practice 
Transform raw transactional records into structured, decision-ready features
Explore behavioural and temporal purchasing dynamics across customer cohorts
Evaluate the predictive value of consumer, operational, and promotional variables
Develop interpretable modelling outputs to inform marketing, retention, and business strategy

🔍 Methodology & Analytical Approach

This project applied a research-guided data science methodology, including:

Data Profiling & Pre-Processing systematic handling of missing, inconsistent, and noisy values ethical and responsible treatment of customer-related attributes feature standardisation and categorical encoding
Feature Engineering & Behaviour Modelling purchase frequency and recency indicators payment and subscription behaviour profiling temporal purchasing trends and seasonality signals
Exploratory & Statistical Analysis cohort-level behavioural comparisons relationship patterns between incentives and purchasing outcomes identification of high-value and at-risk segments
Predictive Modelling & Evaluation model development and validation performance benchmarking across feature sets interpretation of feature influence and business implications

🎯 Key Outcomes & Contributions

This work demonstrates capability in: translating raw business data into analytically meaningful features integrating applied statistics with machine learning workflows generating interpretable insights for real-world business contexts combining technical modelling with ethical and responsible analysis It reflects a strong focus on research-informed analytical thinking, reproducible methodology, and practical decision-support modelling within a commercial data environment.
